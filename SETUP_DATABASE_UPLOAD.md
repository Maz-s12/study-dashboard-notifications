## Railway Deployment

The upload functionality is designed to work with Railway's persistent storage:
- Production uploads go to `/data/uploads`
- Database files are stored in `/data/study.db`
- Backups are created in `/data/` with timestamps

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to the Settings page
2. Click "Select Database File" to choose a .db file
3. Click "Upload & Save Changes" to replace the current database
4. A backup of the existing database will be created automatically
5. The page will refresh to show updated database statistics

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that the uploaded file is a valid SQLite database
2. Verify the `/data` directory has write permissions
3. Check the server logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure the file size is under 50MB
